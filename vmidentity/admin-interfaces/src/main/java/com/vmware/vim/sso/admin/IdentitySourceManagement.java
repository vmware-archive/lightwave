 * Provides operations for configuring Identity Sources to SSO and listing them

 * <p>
 * Identity Source provide means to attach one or more domains to SSO. Domain is
 * any store for users and groups the SSO server could use. There are four
 * Identity Source types:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The <b>System</b> Identity Source which brings the system domain, where
 * the principals are stored locally. This is the only domain SSO has write
 * access to. See {@link PrincipalManagementService}.</li>
 * <li>The <b>Local OS</b> Identity Source which brings the localOS domain backed
 * by the local Operating System storage.</li>
 * <li>The <b>Native AD</b> Identity Source which brings all domains from the AD
 * topology.</li>
 * <li><b>LDAP</b> Identity Sources which bring the corresponding domain backed
 * by the LDAP server. The supported LDAP servers are AD and OpenLDAP.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Refer to {@link IdentitySources} and {@link GenericIdentitySource} for more
 * information.
 * <p>
 * Note that the System Identity Source cannot be changed in any way, while all
 * the other could be registered and deleted at any time.
 * <p>
 * Note also that this interface only allows configuring identity sources in
 * SSO. The users, groups and domain configuration cannot be modified. The
 * content of the domains besides the System domain is read-only for the SSO
 * Server.
